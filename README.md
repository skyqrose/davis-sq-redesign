This is a hypothetical map of Davis Square if Elm St, which has dozens of restaurants and storefronts, were made a walkable pedestrian space.

It was inspired by [this Twitter post](https://twitter.com/BrendanJKearney/status/866028770649681925). Discussions about it are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skyqrose/status/867314846957801472) and [DreamWidth](http://davis-square.dreamwidth.org/3616076.html), but my most up-to-date plan will be here.

If you have contacts within the Somerville planning board, I'd be interested in making this actually happen.
